# Wearables E-Commerce Project

We created an E-commerce website to display different types of wearable technology. Although users cannot currently purchase the products, it does simulate a purchase without the transaction information and updates stock quantities as well.

The stack is React.Js, Redux, Node.Js, and styled-components.

The node server should be RESTful and follow REST principles, at least to the extent we learned during the bootcamp.
