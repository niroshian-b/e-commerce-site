# Wearables E-Commerce Project

We created an E-commerce website to display different types of wearable technology. Although users cannot currently purchase the products, it does simulate a purchase without the transaction information and updates stock quantities as well.

The stack is React.Js, Redux, Express, Node.Js.

The node server should be RESTful and follow REST principles, at least to the extent we learned during the bootcamp.
